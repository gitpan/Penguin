How time flies.  Here at last is Penguin3.

Known problems: this probably doesn't work on a Mac.

This is the second release candidate of One Penguin, the first public
version of Penguin.

Although this is 92% of the way towards what I want to release, it
still isn't exactly where it needs to be yet.  This release is
a bugfix release of One_Penguin-pre1; I expect that the beta
testing of this release will result in something that is very,
very close to a releasable thing.

For information about what Penguin is, consult the FAQ; the
rest of this document (and indeed this release) is somewhat technical.

That said, here are the things which have changed since the
last release candidate:

1.  Unable to work around problems with the latest PGP module,
    I wrote my own PGP module (FPGP.pm).  It acts like the PGP
    module, but implements *only* digital signatures and
    verification.  Also, it's a lot smaller and simpler, and
    it hides the PGP user's password in a more secure fashion.
    
2.  I added the 'getinfo' method to the Channel interface.
    This allows Penguin programs to discover what the remote
    end's hostname is without breaking encapsulation.  I'll
    probably add the ability to 'setinfo' a line of user-
    understandable text.

3.  penguind is a bit more macho, and it handles problems better.

4.  Various bugs, typos and oversights have been fixed.
